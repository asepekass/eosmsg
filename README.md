# EOSMsg

The project goal is to provide a simple way to develop and deploy DApps clients while enabling the communication between DApp users using their EOS accounts to authenticate.

As part of the EOS community, we fully embrace project transparency and also intend to leverage the community input to deliver a secure platform to build DApps.  

The project source code is available on GitHub with the GPL3 license. 

We value your input and are always open to suggestions and contributions.
